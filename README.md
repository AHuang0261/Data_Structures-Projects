Data Structures Projects
This repo contains work from my data structures class. A brief description of each project is listed below.
HW1: Converts between hypothetical currencies. Practice with object oriented programming with interfaces, abstract classes, and inheritance. 
HW2: Takes in a string of numbers and arithmetic operators (i.e. a mathematical expression) and returns what the answer. Involves use of stack data structure. 
HW3: Calculates all primes up to a certain integer using queues. Includes exception handling. 
HW4: Creates an expression tree out of a string of numbers and arithmetic operators. 
HW 5&6: Implements Huffman coding as a Huffman tree and using it to compress messages. Involves use of heap data structure.
